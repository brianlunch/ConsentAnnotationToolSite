Choices for consent are not symmetric,"Freely Given (R43, A4-11)","consent' of the data subject means any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her. If there is no reject button an affirmative action to not consent cannot be made."
Nudging towards giving consent,"Freely Given (R43, A4-11)","consent' of the data subject means any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her. If there is no reject button an affirmative action to not consent cannot be made."
Interface blocks access,"Freely Given (R43, A4-11)","consent' of the data subject means any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her. If there is no reject button an affirmative action to not consent cannot be made."
Controls for preference are confusing,"Specific (A4-11, A7-2)","consent' of the data subject means any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her."
Wording of information is not specific,"Information Provision (A13, A14)","Where personal data relating to a data subject are collected from the data subject, the controller shall, at the time when personal data are obtained, provide the data subject with all required information"
Disparity between expression of consent and withdrawal,Withdrawal (A7-3),"The data subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time. 2The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. 3Prior to giving consent, the data subject shall be informed thereof. 4It shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent."
